## FAQ ‚ùì

**Q: Why are some scripts still loading after disabling?**  
A: This could be due to:  
- Caching plugins/servers (clear cache)
- Scripts loaded via non-standard methods (enable Compatibility Mode)
- Theme/plugin updates resetting configurations

**Q: Does this work with page builders?**  
A: Yes! Tested with Elementor, Divi, and Gutenberg. Some dynamic content may require rescanning.

**Q: What happens if I disable a critical script?**  
A: The plugin shows warnings for dependencies. Test changes on staging first.
